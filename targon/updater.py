    Automatically updates the Targon codebase to the latest version available on the specified branch.

    This function checks the remote repository for the latest version of Targon by fetching the VERSION file from the specified branch.
    If the local version is older than the remote version, it performs a git pull to update the local codebase to the latest version.
    After successfully updating, it restarts the application with the updated code.

    Args:
    - branch (str): The name of the branch to check for updates. Defaults to "main".

    Note:
    - The function assumes that the local codebase is a git repository and has the same structure as the remote repository.
    - It requires git to be installed and accessible from the command line.
    - The function will restart the application using the same command-line arguments it was originally started with.
    - If the update fails, manual intervention is required to resolve the issue and restart the application.
