# Running a Validator

**Validator Prerequisites**

- Docker installed (see docs/docker.md)
- Basic compute resources (any cpu server)

## Validator Installation

**1. Setup Validator CPU Server**

Follow the steps in amd-cpus.md to setup your hardware for the validator virtual
machine.

**2. Environment Setup**

Create a `.env` file in the project directory:

```bash
### Required
HOTKEY_PHRASE="your hotkey phrase"
MONGO_USERNAME=
MONGO_PASSWORD=
VALIDATOR_IP="ipv4 address of the vali"

### Optional

# Sets a multiplier on all http connection timeouts
TIMEOUT_MULT=1

## Sends discord notifications for things like setting weights
# DISCORD_URL=

### Dev Variables (dont set unless needed)

## Netuid validator is running on. Useful for testnet
# NETUID=4

## Chain to connect to
# CHAIN_ENDPOINT=wss://entrypoint-finney.opentensor.ai:443
```

> **Note** both mongo environment keys are keys **you define** and can be
> whatever you want. We suggest using the output of
> `tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 24; echo`. Run twice, and use one as
> the password and one as the username. These **do not** need to be double
> quoted in the .env file

**3. Pull validator VM**

Use `tvm/install` binary on the CPU server with the following arguments

- `--hotkey-phrase`: Your validator Hotkey Phrase
- `--node-type`: vali-cpu
- `--submit`: Actually submit and download image
- `--service-url`: http://tvm.targon.com
- `--vm-download-dir`: location you want to download vm (i.e /vms/manifold)

**4. Start the VM**

Go to the vm-download-dir, and into the unzipped folder that is newly created.
Run `sudo launch.sh` to start the vm.

To stop the vim, use `ps -aux | grep qemu` followed by `sudo kill -9 [puid]`,
where puid is the second column of the output row prefixed by `root`.

**5. Start the validator**

To initalize the validator, first install targon-cli (see cli docs for
installation) **on the server hosting the vm** and run
`targon-cli vali init [path to .env file]`. This will prompt the user to confirm
the passed environment file. This must be done on the server where the VM is
running. This will start the validator with the environment variables passed.

## Validator Monitoring and Maintenance

**Logs**

To get logs, first you must get a list of the running containers using
`targon-cli vali containers`. Then, you can view the logs of any of the
containers using `targon-cli vali logs --container [container name]`.

**Updates**

To update the validator running in the VM, either repull and re-init the VM, or
run `targon-cli vali update`.
