# Confidential GPU Mining Setup
### Miner Prerequisites
> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️  
> It is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** that you have BIOS
> access to your machines. You will be adjusting the configurations throughout
> the process and delays from providers are expected. Without BIOS access, you
> may face significant delays or be unable to complete the setup process.


This doc provides setup scripts and instructions for running miners in **confidential computing environments** with both **CPU (AMD SEV-SNP)** and **GPU passthrough (NVIDIA Hopper series)**.

# Launching TVM
After completing all the prerequisite steps above, you are ready to run TVM.
This process will:

1. Attest your hardware configuration
1. Execute the launch script for TVM
1. Verify the Confidential Compute environment

If you encounter any errors during this process, please review and correct your
hardware configuration according to the guidelines in the previous sections.

## TVM Configuration

1. **Required Arguments**

   - `--hotkey-phrase`: Your miner Hotkey Phrase
   - `--node-type`: cpu or nvcc
   - `--submit`: Whether to actually submit and download image
   - `--service-url`: http://tvm.targon.com
   - `--vm-download-dir`: location you want to download vm
   - `--host-machine-storage`: maximum storage available on host-machine in TB (integer only, no decimals)

> **⚠️ Important Storage Warning**: If you specify the wrong storage size for `--host-machine-storage` and qcow2 cannot grow until the mentioned size, the machine will stop earning emission. Ensure you provide the correct amount of storage available on your host machine in TB. Also, check the minimum storage requirement for storage based on your platform type.

1. **Accessing Your Keys**

   ```bash
   cd bittensor
   cd wallets
   cd default  # or your wallet name
   cd hotkeys
   cat <your_hotkey_name>
   ```

   This will display your hotkey information:

   ```json
   {
     "accountId": "0x...",
     "publicKey": "0x...",
     "privateKey": "...",
     "secretPhrase": "wool ...",
     "secretSeed": "0x...",
     "ss58Address": "5..."
   }
   ```


## TVM Installation

1. **Clone Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manifold-inc/targon.git
   cd targon
   ```

2. **Run TVM Installer**

   **For AMD CPU Servers:**

   ```bash
   sudo ./tvm/install --service-url http://tvm.targon.com \
                      --vm-download-dir ./ \
                      --submit \
                      --hotkey-phrase "your phrase" \
                      --node-type cpu \
                      --host-machine-storage 21TB \
                      --launch-vm
   ```

   **For Intel TDX + Hopper GPUs:**

   ```bash
   sudo ./tvm/install --service-url http://tvm.targon.com \
                      --vm-download-dir ./ \
                      --submit \
                      --hotkey-phrase "your phrase" \
                      --node-type nvcc \
                      --host-machine-storage 21TB \
                      --launch-vm
   ```

   > ✅ **Tip:** To test without submitting to the network, remove the `--submit --service-url` flags.


### Additional TVM Installer Flags

If you encounter any issues during verification, ensure that:

- All prerequisite steps were completed successfully
- Your GPU is properly configured for Confidential Compute
- Your keys are correctly formatted and valid

At this point, all setup on your TVM nodes is complete.



# Updating or Running Miner

After setting up your TVM nodes, you need to update your miner configuration to
report the IP addresses of each CVM you are running.

1. **Update/Create the Configuration File** Edit `config.json` file to include
   the IP addresses of your TVM nodes. Add them to the list of endpoints that
   your miner reports to the network, along with any other desired parameters.

   Example `config.json`

   ```json
    {
    // ONLY include pure IP address of each node and its bid (in cents per hour per gpu)
    "nodes": [{"ip":"0.0.0.0", "price": 120}, {"ip":"0.0.1.1", "price": 220}],
    "hotkey_phrase": "one one one one one three one one one one one two",
    // External ip of your miner, used to register axon on bittensor
    "ip": "160.202.129.179",
    // Port for miner to use
    "port": 7777,
    // Chain endpoint for your miner to connect to
    "chain_endpoint": "wss://test.finney.opentensor.ai:443",
    // Netuid to use, only change when running testnet miner on 337
    "netuid": 4,
    // Min stake in alpha required for validators to get nodes
    "min_stake": 1000
    }
   ```

> **Note**: Make sure to keep your TVM node IPs up to date. If you add or remove
> TVM nodes, update this configuration accordingly.

1. **Start Miner** Run
   `docker compose -f docker-compose.miner.yml up -d --build`
