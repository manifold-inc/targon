# Targon: The Confidential Decentralized AI Cloud

Targon is a next-generation AI infrastructure platform that leverages
Confidential Compute (CC) and Protected pcie (PPCIE) technology to secure the
entire stack. By providing a secure execution environment from hardware to
application layers, Targon enables verifiable and trustworthy operations across
the entire infrastructure in a decentralized fashion.
